# TODO

I keep forgetting what to do so I'll save it here temporarily:
Ideally each one will be a commit.

## Not even necessary I think
- [ ] Prettify HTML output

## Could do it now
- [ ] Config file
- [ ] Make <head> more SEO friendly
- [ ] Auto navigation generation
- [ ] "Page" variable for jinja (btw variables inside the markdown are not replaced yet)
- [ ] Better check for skipping compilation (+ pass the regen option)

## Meh I'm lazy
- [ ] Base CSS
- [ ] Link checking

## I feel lazier with these
- [ ] Classes for links (& codeblocks)
- [ ] Pygments (requires classes for codeblocks I think)

## Even lazier
- [ ] Make file/directory-specific `static/` associations (most likely will end up being a file with a map, maybe even allow regexes? or check page variables/metadata?)
